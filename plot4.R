## Author: Sriharsha M S
## Question:
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Read PM2.5 emissions dataset

# Read emission source classification dataset

# Use the 'Short.Name' field to find the coal combustion-related sources

# Get the emissions from coal combustion-related sources
coal_emissions <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% scc_coal$SCC, ]
# Get the total emissions from coal combustion-related sources by year
